# Building a Modern Newsroom with Custom AI Tools

This guide provides a blueprint for journalists, editors, and researchers to create their own custom AI applications using prompt-based development platforms like Google's AI Studio. By writing a simple, structured prompt, you can generate functional web apps that streamline workflows, uncover new insights, and accelerate the entire news production cycle.

## The Prompt Framework: How to Build Your App

The core principle is simple: a clear, well-structured prompt acts as the blueprint for your application. You don't need to be a programmer; you just need to be able to describe what you want.

Here is a simple framework you can adapt to build almost any tool:

```
Create a [App Type, e.g., "Web App"] called "[App Name]".

Description: [A one-sentence summary of the app's purpose and value].

The user will provide [describe the user input, e.g., 'an audio file', 'a URL to an article', 'a block of text'].

The app will use the Gemini API to [describe the core AI task, e.g., 'transcribe the audio', 'summarize the article', 'check the text for facts'].

The user interface (UI) should have:
1. An input area for the [user input, e.g., a file uploader, a text field].
2. A "[Button Label, e.g., Analyze]" button to start the process.
3. An output area to display [describe the results, e.g., 'the text transcript', 'a bulleted list of key points', 'the fact-check results and sources'].

Key Features:
- [List any specific behaviors, e.g., 'Show a loading indicator while processing.', 'Make results copyable to the clipboard.', 'Display results in a clean, readable card format.']
```

## Newsroom App Blueprints

Here are several examples of how to apply the framework to create powerful newsroom tools.

### 1. Audio Transcription Service
- **Use Case:** Instantly transcribe interviews, press conferences, or field recordings, saving hours of manual work.
- **AI Studio Prompt:**
  > "Create a 'Fast Transcriber' app. The user will upload an audio file (MP3, M4A, or WAV). The app will use the Gemini API to transcribe the audio into text. The UI should have a file uploader, a 'Transcribe' button, and a text area to display the full transcription with a 'Copy Text' button."

### 2. Video Scene Analyzer (This App)
- **Use Case:** Deconstruct video footage for detailed analysis, B-roll selection, or evidence review without manually scrubbing through hours of content.
- **AI Studio Prompt:**
  > "Create a 'Video Scene Analyzer' app. A user uploads a video. The app will capture a frame every 5 seconds and use the Gemini API to generate a detailed description of each frame. The UI should show the video player on the left and a scrollable list of timestamped descriptions on the right. Clicking a timestamp should jump the video to that moment."

### 3. Data Scraper & Summarizer
- **Use Case:** Quickly digest long-form articles, dense research papers, or government reports to extract the most critical information and talking points.
- **AI Studio Prompt:**
  > "Create a 'Web Summarizer' app. The user will paste a URL into a text input field. The app will use the Gemini API to read the content of the article and provide a 5-point bulleted summary of the key information. The UI needs an input for the URL, a 'Summarize' button, and a card to display the generated summary."

### 4. Fact-Checking Assistant
- **Use Case:** Empower journalists to rapidly verify claims, statistics, or statements made by public figures against information available on the web.
- **AI Studio Prompt:**
  > "Create a 'Fact-Checker' app. A user will enter a statement into a text area. The app will use the Gemini API with Google Search grounding to evaluate the claim and provide a summary of its findings. The UI should display the AI's response and a list of the web page URLs it used for verification."

### 5. Headline Generator
- **Use Case:** Overcome writer's block and A/B test different angles for a story by generating multiple creative and engaging headlines.
- **AI Studio Prompt:**
  > "Create a 'Headline Helper' app. The user will paste the full text of their article into a large text area. The app should use the Gemini API to suggest 5 different headlines for the article, categorized by style (e.g., 'Direct & Informative', 'Intriguing & Question-based', 'SEO-Friendly'). The UI should show the input text area and a list of the categorized headlines."

### 6. Public Sentiment Analyzer
- **Use Case:** Gauge public opinion on breaking news or a published story by analyzing social media comments, reader feedback, or forum discussions.
- **AI Studio Prompt:**
  > "Create a 'Sentiment Analyzer' app. The user will paste a block of text, like a collection of comments, into a text area. The app will use the Gemini API to analyze the text and return a summary of the overall sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) with a percentage breakdown. The UI should display the results clearly, perhaps using a simple bar chart."
